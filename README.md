There has been a rise in accessibility of online applications and a surge across
social platforms for opinion sharing, online review websites, and personal blogs,
which have captured the attention of stakeholders such as customers,
organizations, and governments to analyze and explore these opinions. There exists
some research to predict the consumer reviews then automatically rating individual
food items of a restaurant based on online customer reviews and categorize it as
positive, negative, or neutral. Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis can be defined
as the task of detecting, extracting and classifying opinions on something. It is a
type of processing of the natural language (NLP). It involves a way of development
for the collection and examination of comments and opinions on food reviews. The
process of information extraction is very important because it is a very useful
technique but also a challenging task. The existing techniques for sentiment
analysis include machine learning (supervised), and lexical-based approaches.
Hence, the main aim of this project is to predict the rating based on review of the
food.
